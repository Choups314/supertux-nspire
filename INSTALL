REQUIREMENTS
============

 * A functional native toolchain (i.e. that target the build machine).  
 * A functional ARM toolchain able to compile C++ code for the TI-nspire.  
 * A third-party TI-nspire jailbreaker to execute native code on the  
   calculator.
 * A TI-nspire emulator OR a third-party program able to send files to the  
   calculator.  

We strongly recommend to use the NdLess jailbreaker, and its SDK that provide  
a complete ARM toolchain and some extra librairies. To get more informations  
about NdLess, refer to the [NdLess website](http://ndless.me/)  

To send files to the TI-nspire, we recommend to use TiLP (works on several   
platforms : UNIX, Windows, Macintosh). To get more informations about TiLP,  
refer to the [project website](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilp/)  

Assure that the ARM toolchain is in your $PATH variable.  

BUILDING
========

To build the game, simply launch those commands :  

`
   ./configure  
   make  
`

You can pass extra parameters to the configure script, to define a special  
compilation behavior. Currently, the following parameters are available :  
 *There is currently no parameters*  

LAUNCHING THE GAME
==================

The build step produce a supertux.tns file.  
You can either transfer this file to your TI-nspire calculator (e.g. using  
TiLP), or run it in an emulator.
