SuperTux-nSpire
===============

SuperTux-nSpire is an adaptation of the SuperTux game for the TI-nSpire calculator.
All the images, the sounds and a large part of the source code has been totally inspired or copied from the original project.
All credits for these parties belongs to the author and the contributors of the original project. 


DESCRIPTION
===========

This description comes from the README.md file from the original project :
   SuperTux is a jump'n run like game, with strong inspiration from the
   Super Mario Bros games for Nintendo.

   Run and jump through multiple worlds, fighting off enemies by jumping
   on them or bumping them from below.  Grabbing power-ups and other stuff
   on the way.

The supertux-nspire project does not intend to redo the original game, but it 
intends to make the game available for the TI-nspire architecture. This task
include :
   - Redo the hardware layer : access the screen and possibly the sound.
   - Redo the architecutre specific stuff (i.e. make everything compatible for
     the ARM (the TI-nspire processor architecture).
   - Adapt the game (e.g. the game and the menus) to fit the small screen of
     the calculator (that has a resolution of 240x320 pixels).


STORY
=====

This story comes from the README.md file from the original project :
       - Penny gets captured! -

   Tux and Penny were out having a nice
   picnic on the ice fields of Antarctica.
   Suddenly, a creature jumped from
   behind an ice bush, there was a flash,
   and Tux fell asleep!

   When Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny
   is missing. Where she lay before now
   lies a letter. "Tux, my arch enemy!"
   says the letter. "I have captured
   your beautiful Penny and have taken her
   to my fortress. The path to my fortress
   is littered with my minions. Give up on
   the thought of trying to reclaim her,
   you haven't a chance! -Nolok"

   Tux looks and see Nolok's fortress in
   the distance. Determined to save his
   beloved Penny, he begins his journey.
